<h1>Methods in Functional Data Analysis: Modeling Response Curves as Functions of Experimental Factors in Designed Experiments</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this Master's project, introduces different methods of analyzing designed experiments that have comparatively small datasets, with a focused aim of modeling functional response curves directly asfunctions of the experimental factors. In contrast to conventional experimenters who typicallyrely on scalar characteristics for modeling, our research advocates for the modeling of the entirefunctional response curve, a strategy that has proven to be informative and valuable in industrysettings. This unique approach distinguishes us from typical functional data analyses as we aim to model the curves as functions of experimental factors. By modeling our response curves as functions of experimental factors we are able to observe how changes in experimental factors influence the shape and behavior of the curves, providing insights into the dynamics of the underlying system. This allows for the optimization of these factors for desired responses, thus enhancing prediction accuracy. In this Master’s Project we investigate JMP’s Fit Curve method, functional principal components (FPC), and a Bayesian hierarchical two-stage mixed-effects model for this project of modeling functional response curves as functions of experimental factors
